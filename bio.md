<h3  style="margin:auto 20%"> Liz is currently traveling the nation teaching high school students how to dance and inspiring them by speaking her raw truth. She has hopes of demolishing the borders that keep our communities separated. </h3>
<p style="margin-top:40px">
Countless children are introduced to dance daily as a mere means to burn excess energy. Different was the case for
three year old Liz LeGrande, whom couldn’t explain love at the time, but experienced it as she commenced a
passionate journey of self while entering Christine’s School of Dance with her father. As her matchstick like legs
connected with her first pair of ballet shoes, it was that exact moment that sparked a fire within that would only burn
brighter. In a world constantly requiring us to recreate ourselves, dance became Liz’s greatest tool for transformation.
This small studio, comprised of nothing but mirrors and ballet barres, became a catalyst in Liz’s personal development.
These studio staples respectively taught her how to not only look at, but within herself and also how to support herself.
Ultimately how she showed up on the dance floor was how she showed up in life.

Liz’s early dedication in dance provided world renown training, but most importantly, an escape. Liz channeled her
experiences growing up mixed raced in a racially repressed community through dance at Pebblebrook High School,
Cobb County’s School for Excellence in the Performing Arts. Liz graduated a year ahead of schedule as a dance major
and vocal minor, departing early to train with The Atlanta Ballet. Her efforts afforded The Promising Artist Scholarship
from The University of the Arts, where shortly after her journey to Philadelphia began, she was forced to withdrawal for
an injury resulting from malnutrition. In the summer of 2008, Liz checked herself into a rehab facility for an eating
disorder in fear of her life. Unbeknownst to her at the time, something inside her had already died. Liz learned that the
road to recovery was about waking up to the glory of God already within her and surrendering to his grace. She began
letting go and surrendering to life so deeply that she rediscovered love in places within herself she hadn’t before.

<b>Against even the discretion of her own agent, whom suggested she would never make it in LA, 19 year old
Liz moved across country in pursuit of her dream. She fearlessly packed her belongings, relocating to Los
Angeles to find haven on a friends’ couch and crash any and every audition that she could gain access.</b> As
reward to her faith in her God given abilities, Liz booked and booked often. Liz’s unique ability to cross genres has
resulted in her being considered one of the most versatile dancers in the world, which is exemplified through her
bookings. Liz has made stellar appearances in a host of T.V shows and films such as;<i> Glee, Dancing With The Stars,
My Crazy Ex GirlFriend, Disney’s Shake It Up, Step Up (HighWater), Bun Heads, America’s Best Dance Crew, Behind
The Candelabra and more. Not to mention, providing stage and video support for some of the industry’s biggest artists
such as; Usher, Beyoncé, Ciara, Katy Perry, Robin Thicke, Jessie J, Flo Rida, Iggy Azalea, Charlie Puth, The
Wanted, Kelly Clarkson and more.</i>

Liz’s journey through dance has brought the opportunity to submerge into different cultures and customs while touring,
and has been a catalyst for Liz’s advocacy for equality and human connection. Liz’s latest project, abunDANCE, is a
one of a kind combination of dance and meditation centered around fusing the two together to connect ones inner
state with their outer... A one of a kind class that is designed to reconnect you with your body, mind and spirit.
